# .NET-Web-services

Developed a temperature convention web service and another to sort a string of numbers, separated by commas. I then took those services and added it as features in my web browser.
I also added a simple calculator in the web browser, with floating point +,-, *, and / operations (no service call was required). The last function was a text encryption decryption. Instead of using the localhost service, I implemented the service in the ASU Repository at:http://venus.sod.asu.edu/WSRepository/Services/EncryptionWcf/Service.svc
